# sas_grid

sas_grid generates the solvent accessible surface grid around a given molecular structure. 
It reads a .xyz file and writes out a new file containing the grid point coordinates (labeled as XX) around it.

sas_grid is a free software written in Fortran 2003 language, being available at https://github.com/colombarifm/sas_grid under the GPLv3+ License. 
It runs under Linux environment with gfortran/gcc 5.4+ compilers.

## Build with fpm
Download the github repository and build it with fpm

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/colombarifm/themis.git
   cd sas_grid
   fpm build
```


## usage

`sas_grid --input [FILE] --radius [RADIUS] --factor [FACTOR]`

`[FILE]` is a .xyz coordinate file.

`[RADIUS]` is the solvent probe radius, in Angstrom.

`[FACTOR]` is an integer factor for the tessellation sphere. For each atom-centered sphere, N_points = 2 + factor^2 * 10.

## TODO

vdW radii for transition elements are still missing. The code will be updated soon.
